OASIS
(Open Agile Source Integrated Suite)

OASIS is an open source, Java based, and platform independent FitNesse plugin that allows testers and developers the ability to automate tests using a variety of different tools quickly and with ease. Built around the Xebium framework, OASIS seeks to increase the capabilities of testing by adding in thick client and load testing support.

Using the various tools built into the framework, a user can quickly construct an automated test without much training and with no coding background necessary. The ultimate goal of OASIS is to increase collaboration between testing and development, while also preserving the relevancy of a test case to business owners, product owners, and other analysts in an agile environment.

OASIS pulls from the open source tools:

-Sikuli
-Synthuse
-Xebium (FitNesse + Selenium)
-JMeter

For examples of how to use OASIS, please visit the wiki page and Youtube videos.
